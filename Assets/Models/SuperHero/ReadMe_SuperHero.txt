Hi And thanks for your purchase!


++++++++++++++
+ VERION 1.0 +
++++++++++++++

Quick start:

Locate the SuperHeroDemo scene in the Scenes folder and open the scene.
Press the play button. Now use the arrow keys to make our hero run around.
The prefab has and needs 3 components to work:
 - an Animator with the "IdleRunJump" animation Controller on it
 - A Character Controller
 - The IdleRunJump script that will handle the key inputs

Tips:
	when swapping or adding new animation make sure they are set to humanoid.
	Not doing so will break all animations.

Includes:

+ Playable animated demo character using the mecanim system.

+ 3 Idle animations 1 Run and 1 Jump animation.

You can find various animations in the unity sample files.

The UV-unwrap is set up so you can easly add decals such as Logo's.
You can also change the colors fairly easy.

Enjoy!

Best Regards,
